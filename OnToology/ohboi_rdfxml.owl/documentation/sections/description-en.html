The ontology Open Bacterial Ontology for Infectious diseases, O(h)BOI!, that will create a knowledge model base around human bacteria-caused infectious diseases comprising medical, epidemiological, microbiological and molecular data. To this end, this ontology is intended to be useful as means of surveillance in case of the rise of an epidemic. Having epidemiological data linked to molecular data present in pathogens and underlying disease pathogenesis will help fasten tracing data and predicting patterns in the progression of an epidemic or a specific disease. An initiative of bacterial emergence control through computational approaches is decisive and urgent, especially in the current state of affairs where bacterial resistance to antibiotics threatens to cause a global crisis across public health, economy, and ecology. Intended users are Physicians, researchers, epidemiological experts, pharmacologists and Bioinformaticians .This ontology represents information from microbial phenotypes and metabolism associated to bacterial pathogens, as well as pathogenesis mechanisms, transmission and resistance status to treatments. It also represents approved treatment practices and symptomatology of infectious diseases along with the pathways that are affected in it. Some markers and chemical information about drugs and toxins combined with epidemiological history/ databases/clinical assays and geographical knowledge</span>
